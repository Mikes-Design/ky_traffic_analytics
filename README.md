Mapping Congestion: How Freight & High-Traffic Locations Impact Road Flow

Purpose

This project aims to analyze the relationship between freight-generating facilities, major traffic generators, and real-time congestion in Kentucky. By integrating multiple datasets, the study seeks to identify patterns in traffic bottlenecks, freight movement, and commuter delays.


Scope

The analysis focuses on Kentucky’s freight hubs, commercial zones, and high-traffic areas, using datasets from kygeonet to map major freight facilities and traffic generators. Real-time traffic data will supplement the study to examine how different transportation sources contribute to congestion.

Objectives

• Identify congestion hotspots influenced by freight and commuter traffic.

• Analyze freight movement and its impact on overall road flow.

• Correlate real-time traffic data with major traffic generators.

• Propose optimization strategies for improved traffic management and logistics efficiency.


Core Features


Data Collection & Description 

• Load two Kentucky datasets, freight sites and traffic generators

• Explain what each column means and show basic stats


Initial Analysis 

• Count how many sites there are and calculate simple averages

• Make charts bar graphs, histograms to spot patterns


Mapping 

• Put site locations on an interactive map so you can see where they are 

• Highlight areas with lots of sites


Congestion Check 

• Use available data as a stand-in for traffic jams 

• List the top 5 areas most likely to be congested


Stretch Goals


Live Traffic Overlay 

• Real-time traffic info from a free mapping service


Simple Traffic Prediction 

• Build a basic formula that uses site counts to guess congestion


Basic Dashboard 

• Create a simple web page or app to show maps and charts


Recommendations 

• Write a short list of ideas to help reduce traffic problems based on findings


Frameworks:

Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenRouteService API, Git, GitHub, virtualenv, Streamlit
